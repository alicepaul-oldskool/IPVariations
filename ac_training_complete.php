<p>Instructions: Abstractness vs. Concreteness<br>
  <br>
  In the following module, you will see a series of images.
  
  <br>
  <br>
  Your task is to rate each image on how abstract or how concrete you precieve each
  image to be.
  
  <br>
  <br>
  The scale ranges from 1 to 6, with scores representing the following:
  <br>
  <br>
  1 (very abstract) 2 (abstract) 3 (somewhat abstract) 4 (somewhat concrete)
  5 (concrete) 6 (very concrete).
  
  <br>
  <br>
  Very abstract images are typically non-realistic depictions that do not necessarily
  associate to any particular object, place, or thing.
  
  <br>
  <br>
  Very concrete images are typically realistic depictions that associate with objects,
  places or things.</p>
